1. Transition Strategy
    - How would you assess the current QA team's automation capabilities?
    
    Assessing the team's automation capabilities will involve several key steps:
    a. Automation Strategy Evaluation – Determine whether the team has a well-defined automation strategy that aligns with the product roadmap.
    b. Test Case Review – Assess existing test cases to ensure they are suitable for automation.
    c. Automation Coverage Analysis – Compare automated vs. manual test cases to evaluate overall test coverage.
    d. Tool & Framework Assessment – Analyze the automation tool and framework currently in use to ensure they are the best fit for the product.
    e. Skill & Knowledge Evaluation – Assess each team member’s proficiency with the automation tool and the programming language used.

    These insights will provide a clear understanding of the team's quality mindset, enabling the creation of a structured roadmap to enhance their automation capabilities.

    - Create a 90-day plan for introducing automation while maintaining ongoing manual testing
    
    The plan will be executed in phases, ensuring that ongoing work across all product verticals is considered.
    Phase 1: Gain a thorough understanding of the Application Under Test (AUT) and its architecture.
    Phase 2: Based on insights from Phase 1, identify and finalize the most suitable automation tool that aligns with the application architecture.
    Phase 3: Conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) using the selected tool and present it to stakeholders including QA team members, highlighting its benefits.
    Phase 4: Organize training sessions for the QA team on how to build upon the POC framework and efficiently develop automated tests.
    Phase 5: Set up a QA Sprint Board, break down test cases, and assign them to QA team members. Each QA will work on one test case at a time to gain hands-on experience. By the end of the sprint, each QA will submit a pull request (PR), providing exposure to the end-to-end automation lifecycle.
    Phase 6: Train QAs on integrating test automation into CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment workflows.
    Phase 7: Structure QA sprints into achievable targets, ensuring tasks are completed within the sprint timeline.
    Phase 8: Assign specific product areas to individual QAs, allowing them to take ownership and enhance automation independently.
    
    This gradual and structured approach ensures that QAs have ample time to adapt to automation best practices without feeling overwhelmed, while still managing their manual testing responsibilities.

    - How would you upskill the team members who don't have automation experience?
    
    To enhance the team's automation skills, I will implement a structured, phased approach:
    Step 1: Educate the QA team on the importance of automation and its impact on efficiency and product quality.
    Step 2: Familiarize the team with the automation tool and the programming language used.
    Step 3: Organize knowledge-sharing sessions to encourage learning and collaboration.
    Step 4: Assign small, achievable tasks to help team members gain hands-on experience with the automation tool.
    Step 5: Provide support in identifying and resolving blockers that arise during the learning process.
    Step 6: Establish quarterly targets for each QA team member to ensure continuous learning and focus.
    
    This structured approach will help the team gradually build their automation expertise while staying engaged and motivated

2. Process Improvement
    - What metrics would you implement to track testing effectiveness?
    
    The key metrics I will incorporate are as follows:
    Test Case Coverage: This metric will help identify gaps in our test coverage, allowing me to focus on addressing those gaps.
    Percentage of Automated Tests: This will enable me to analyze regression efforts and plan releases more efficiently.
    Percentage of Non-Automated Tests: This metric will help determine the effort required to test specific features or products.
    Number of Active Defects: This will provide insight into the overall quality of the product and aid in release planning.
    Number of Rejected Bugs/Defects: This will help identify knowledge gaps among QAs, as these reports may indicate unnecessary time spent on issues that should not have been raised.
    Number of Accepted Bugs/Defects: This will reflect the overall quality of the engineering team’s work.
    Regression Pass Percentage: This metric will give an overall view of the quality of the release candidate.
    Automation Execution Pass Percentage: This will help assess the reliability of the automation testing suite and identify any flakiness.
    Regression Fail Percentage: This will provide additional insights into the effectiveness of our regression testing efforts.
    Customer-reported Defects: The number of defects reported by users after the product release, serving as a measure of product quality in the real world.
    
    These metrics will guide our efforts in improving product quality and testing efficiency.
    
    - How would you integrate automated testing into the current CI/CD pipeline?
    
    To integrate the automation solution into the CI/CD pipeline, I will first need to understand the deployment processes in both lower environments and production. Once I have sufficient insights, I will set up automatic execution of the test suite for each deployment. Additionally, we need to make strategic decisions about which tests to include for each deployment and environment type. For instance, we might run all regression tests in the test environment, only sanity tests in the staging environment, and just smoke tests in the production environment.
    
    - How would you balance the effort between manual and automated testing?
    
    Maintaining a balance between manual and automated testing is crucial for ensuring continuous delivery. We need to clearly identify which areas require automation and which still need manual oversight, even after automation is implemented. It's essential to prioritize automating critical features that are repetitive and must be tested before each release. For example, the transfers module in a banking application is vital and needs thorough testing before releasing anything to the client, so it should be prioritized for automation. At the same time, ongoing manual testing efforts will be necessary for new features that are not yet stable enough for automation.
    
    - What would your test automation pyramid look like for a web application?

    The test automation pyramid consists of three main layers:
    Base Layer: Unit tests, which focus on testing individual components in isolation, ensuring they function correctly on their own.
    Middle Layer: Integration tests, where components interact with both internal and external systems to validate their integration and behavior.
    Top Layer: End-to-end tests, which ensure the entire application operates seamlessly from start to finish, simulating real user journeys.

3. Team Management

    - How would you handle a situation where the team is falling behind on testing deadlines?
    
    The first step is to address the current situation by assessing the tasks at hand and collaborating with the team to prioritize what should be tested first. After that, we need to develop a plan to complete the testing within the specified timeframe. The next step is to analyze the root causes of the problem and brainstorm strategies for improving our planning to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
    
    - What's your approach to knowledge sharing and documentation?
    
    I believe in a continuous knowledge-sharing process where QA team members collaborate weekly to discuss pre-decided topics. We can organize these sessions with detailed topics in advance and send calendar invites to all team members, ensuring everyone is aware of the upcoming knowledge-sharing opportunities. Documentation is also crucial for QA, as it allows us to capture knowledge for future reference. Additionally, recording these knowledge-sharing sessions and compiling them in a central location will make it easier for others to access the information later.
    
    - How would you ensure consistent test coverage across different team members?

    Maintaining test coverage while keeping up with rapid development can be a challenging task. To address this, we need a clear QA process for the team to follow. Here’s the QA process I strongly advocate:

    a. Pre-Grooming: Ensure that QA team members have access to the stories scheduled for discussion in the Backlog Grooming meeting. This preparation allows QA to gain a thorough understanding of the tickets and formulate any questions in advance.
    b. Grooming: Gather the requirements discussed during the backlog grooming session and prepare test scenarios accordingly.
    c. Technical Design Review: Conduct design reviews with the development team to understand the scope and potential impact of the work.
    d. Test Planning: Identify the testing scope as part of the planning process.
    e. Test Case Creation: During the sprint planning meeting, QA team members should create a test case subtask under the user story and document the test cases in the test case management tool.
    f. Review of Test Cases: Have the test cases reviewed by other QA team members or the QA lead.
    g. Test Case Execution: Execute the test cases and accurately update the execution status in the test case management tool. Additionally, add an execution report to the user story for future reference.
